## Take Home Challenges

The following examples have been adapted from [here](https://www.fullstackinterviewing.com/2018/02/02/the-ultimate-guide-to-kicking-ass-on-take-home-coding-challenges.html#3-the-basic-types-of-take-home-coding-challenges)

### Drag and Drop

Create two large squares on the screen and fill one of them with smaller squares. The design, color, and layout is completely up to you, but make sure that each small square is uniquely identifiable using text, color, etc.

Requirements:

- Any small box dragged and dropped over another small box should swap positions with the other small box
- Any small box dragged and dropped on the other large square should be moved to that square and swapped with any small box already there
- There should be a button that allows the user to reset the small box positions
- There should be a button that allows the user to randomize the layout and positioning of the small boxes within both large squares

The final project needs to work in the latest stable versions of Chrome and Safari. 

###  Tic Tac Toe App

 Requirements:

 * Build a two player tic tac toe app where a game is played by alternating clicks until the game is won by X, O or is a tie.
 * Include a reset button so that when a game ends, the board can be cleared and a new game can begin.

 Bonuses:

 * Make the board fully responsive
 * Allow for more than 1 game to be played simultaneously


 ### Photo App

 Create a web page that shows a photo in a lightbox view, with the ability to move to the next/previous photos and display the photo title. You can use any public API that returns photos (i.e. Flickr, Instagram, Google Image Search, Yahoo Image Search)

It should run without errors in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE.

### Social Media

Use any language/framework/library they choose. You must fetch responses from three separate (mocked) social networks and return them in a single JSON payload in response to an HTTP call.
